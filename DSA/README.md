# Data Structure Algorithms

Mathematics plays an important role in competitive programming, and it is
not possible to become a successful competitive programmer without having
good mathematical skills.

## Logic

The value of a logical expression is either true (1) or false (0).

N - Natural Numbers
Z - Integers
Q - Rational Numbers
R - Real Numbers

The most important logical operators are ¬ (negation), ∧ (conjunction), ∨ (disjunction), ⇒ (implication) and ⇔
(equivalence).

---

The expression ¬A has the opposite value of A. The expression A ∧B is true if both A and B are true, and the expression
A ∨B is true if A or B or both are true. The expression A ⇒ B is true if whenever A is true, also B is true. The
expression A ⇔ B is true if A and B are both true or both false. A predicate is an expression that is true or false 
depending on its parameters. Predicates are usually denoted by capital letters. For example, we can define a predicate
P(x) that is true exactly when x is a prime number. Using this definition, P(7) is true but P(8) is false
